# Development

This integration focuses on Addigy and is using Addigy API for interacting with
the Addigy resources.

## Provider account setup

With access to an Addigy account, generate API `client_id` and `client_secret`
using the instructions in the
[Addigy API Docs](https://support.addigy.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403542544275)

## Authentication

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` file and fill in the variables using the user
information and API token information generated from instructions above.
